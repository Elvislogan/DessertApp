About App
--------------

You use the app to make desserts. I added android activity lifecycle such as onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onRestart(), onStop(), onDestroy() and log messages both basic and complex ones by using Android lifecycle libraries and Observers to the Android console (Logcat). I used Timber Library to generate logs because it;
* Generates the log tag for you based on the class name.
* Helps you avoid showing logs in a release version of your Android app.
* Allows for integration with crash-reporting libraries.
